For instance in 2020, employed students were 1232 while those seeking employment were 287. There was a decline in the number of students employed from 2019 to 2020 (1327 to 1232) but there was almost an equal increase in the number of graduates who enrolled for masters degree in the same year (263 to 340).

However, results showed that only about half of the 4000 respondents leveraged career center workshops and only a little over a half utilized on-campus interview practice offered by the career center.\n\n\n\nThis revealed the gap that exists in students making time to attend career workshops as well as the under-utilization of interview preparation services offered by the career center.\n\n\n\nTherefore, we encourage all students to maximize the use of the career center services to prepare themselves for the job market.\n\n\n\n",
