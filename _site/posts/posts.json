However, results showed that only about half of the 4000 respondents leveraged career center workshops and only a little over a half utilized on-campus interview practice offered by the career center.\n\n\n\nThis revealed the gap that exists in students making time to attend career workshops as well as the under-utilization of interview preparation services offered by the career center.\n\n\n\nTherefore, we encourage all students to maximize the use of the career center services to prepare themselves for the job market.\n\n\n\n",
